# What should I commit?

A commit should represent a **unit of work**.

If you've made changes that represent multiple units of work (e.g., changing how input data are processed, and adding a new model parameter) these should be saved as separate commits.

Try describing out loud the changes you have made, and if you find yourself saying something like "I did X and Y and Z", then the changes should probably divided into multiple commits.
