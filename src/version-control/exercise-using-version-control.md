# Exercise: using version control

Now that you are familiar with the core concepts of version control, consider how they might be applied to your existing work.

- Do you have an existing project or piece of code that could be stored in a repository?

- Have you recently written any code that could be recorded as one or more commits?

- If so, what would you write for the commit messages?

- Have you written some exploratory code or analysis that could be stored in a separate branch?
